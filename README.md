# Screeps3D
A 3D client for the MMORTS Screeps.com

## Goal 
To build a 3D client for Screeps.

## Progress
At this point, Screeps3D is a functional as a viewer. It displays the majority of in-game events and status. There is still very limited ability to interact with the game besides using the console. However, newer game features (like power creeps) have not been implemented.

I'm not currently working on this project, but anyone is free to fork this code.

Roadmap:
* Better client authentication (similar to how official client authenticates)
* Add interaction elements (destroy items/creeps, create/move flags, etc.)
* Add original client features (camera scripting, console macros, hotkeys)
